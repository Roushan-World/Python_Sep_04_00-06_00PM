    "\n",
    " * __In Python, a function is a group of related statements that performs a specific task.__\n",
    " * __Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks. * As our program grows larger and larger, functions make it more organized and manageable.__\n",
    " * __Furthermore, it avoids repetition and makes the code reusable.__\n",
    " * __There are two types of functions:__\n",
    " * __Pre-defined functions__\n",
    " * __User-defined functions.__\n",
    " * __In Python a function defined using the def keyword followed by the function name and parentheses().__\n",
    " * __Keyword def that marks the start of the function header.__\n",
    " * __A function name to uniquely identify the function.__\n",
    " * __Parameters(arguments) through which we pass values to a function. The are optional.__\n",
    " * __A colon(:) to mark the end of the function header.__\n",
    " * __Optional documentation string(docstring) to describe what the function does.__\n",
    " * __One or more valid python statements that make up the function body.__\n",
    " * __Statements must have the same indentation level (usually 4 spaces)__\n",
    " * __An optional return statement to return a value from the function.__\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "# Variables\n",
    "\n",
    " * __The input to a function is called a formal parameter.__\n",
    " * __A variable that is declared inside a function is called a local variable.__\n",
    " * __The parameter only exists within the function (i.e the point where the function starts and stops).__\n",
    " * __A variable that is declared outside a function definition is a global variabel, and its value is accessible and modifiable thoughout the program.__"
